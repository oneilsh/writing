# 5 W's for Data Science

## What is data science?

This is a question I've been asking a lot lately--of myself and colleagues across campus, from Statistics to Computer
Science, and applied fields like Bioinformatics, Public Health, Forestry, and more. Partially this is because of a recent 
grant we've been funded, 
(Data Science for the Public Good)[https://workspace.oregonstate.edu/data-science-for-the-public-good],
where the plan is to build teams to work on data-driven problems with stakeholders in rural Oregon. There are several
educational components as well, where at least a working definition for our own use will be helpful.

I think it's no secret, however, that Data Science doesn't have a universally agreed-upon scope.
